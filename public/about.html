<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a hard worker, proactive and very curious person. I am always studying and trying to figure out new ways to do 
  things and bring emprovements to my work. I am creative and highly passionate about all art forms, and I bring a lot 
  of that to my corporative life with me. 
</p>

<p>Personally, I am shy, but i am also very easy going, and I´m always trying to overcome my bareers and include everyone 
  on my endeavours.
</p>

<p>I have an UX Design background, and worked with some big, medium and small companies during my career. Now, I´m looking 
  for new challenges and ways to bring my UX expertise into the Development field.
